# power-meter
IoT nodes 3-phases Power Meter with electricity to monitor the consumption of a building. The power consumption meter measures the apparent power in a three
phase electrical installation and calculates its true power consumption re-motely.
Communication with the device is achieved using IEEE 802.15.4 trough a gateway.
