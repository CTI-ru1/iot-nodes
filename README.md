# iot-nodes

The overall architecture of our platform is built upon multiple heteroge-
neous installations in school buildings. Each one of these installations con-
sists of a multitude of IoT nodes.
The overall design for the installation of IoT infrastructure consist of:
	- 1. IoT Environmental Devices (On whataver of the 2 versions)
	- 2. IoT Power Meter Devices
	- 3. IoT Gateway
The eagles files and BOM of materials for the first 2 devices can be foound it on the respective folders and the Arduino program too. 
The Gateway program can be found it on: 
The necessary library for include the aplication on the Arduino program are on the folders App aand the different sensors processing are include as objects and the correespondig code can be found it
on the folder UberdaustSensor.
The library resposible of the creation of tree network to access from each node the gateway can be download from
