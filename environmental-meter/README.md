# environmental-meter
IoT Environmental nodes for monitoring a set of parameters such as temperature, humidity,
carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH 4 ) levels, activity and noise levels. 
Communication with these devices is achieved using IEEE 802.15.4 trough a gateway.
We have created two versions of our environmental comfort meter one using analog sensors for Arduino devices (Environmental V1) and a
second one with digital sensors (Environmental V2) that offer more accurate results.
